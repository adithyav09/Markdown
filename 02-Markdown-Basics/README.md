# Paragraph

This is my first paragraph example.

This is my second paragraph example.

This example will feature a break
about here but it will show up on
this same line.

In this last example, I will use a hard  
break to force a break here by  
using two spaces at the end of the line.

# Showing Emphasis

In this first sentence I will _really_ place 
*emphasis* on my words in two different ways.

Next I will write __very__ strong or **bold** text, also in two 
different ways

This example will contain an _intra_ word emphasis. This is a variable
name var\_example\_int but Markdown will render emphaisis by 
default.

- Use asterik instead of underscore for emphasis

# Code Examples
This `rm` command is used to delete files in Bash. 
For example:

The rm command has many options, which can be seen using `man rm`
