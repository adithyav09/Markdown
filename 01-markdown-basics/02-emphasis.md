# Showing Emphasis

In this first sentence I will _really_ place 
*emphasis* on my words in two different ways.

Next I will write __very__ strong or **bold** text, also in two 
different ways

This example will contain an _intra_ word emphasis. This is a variable
name var\_example\_int but Markdown will render emphaisis by 
default.

- Use asterik instead of underscore for emphasis
